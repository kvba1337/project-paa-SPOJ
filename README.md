## Categories

### 0. Intro
Introductory problems focusing on basic input/output handling and simple calculations:
- **Simple Counter**: Counts lines, words, and characters in the input.
- **Life, the Universe, and Everything**: A classic problem that processes numbers until a specific value is encountered.
- **Calculations on Two Numbers**: Performs basic arithmetic operations on pairs of numbers.

### 1. Basic
Fundamental algorithmic problems showcasing common techniques:
- **Simple Numbers Conversion**: Converts numbers between different number systems.
- **Searching the Graph**: Implements DFS and BFS traversal algorithms.
- **Quadratic Equation Roots**: Calculates the roots of quadratic equations with specified precision.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finds the longest common subsequence between two strings.

### 2. Speed
Problems focused on optimization and efficient algorithm implementation:
- **Fractions Calculator**: Evaluates expressions with fractions using a carefully implemented parser.
- **House Organization**: Optimizes a sequence of shelf reorganization operations.

### 3. Approx
Problems requiring approximation algorithms and heuristics:
- **Johnny**: Implements the Largest Differencing Method (LDM) for balancing packet weights.
- **ByteFood**: Solves a food delivery optimization problem using a greedy approach.

## Implementation Details

The solutions are implemented in various programming languages:
- **C++**
